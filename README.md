# Web-Dev-Challenge

Here is my implementation for the Web Dev Challenge! 

My approach was to start building a layout with Grid for the main elements of the app (header, sidebar and main). 
Regarding the responsiveness of the app my implementation method is to use overflow-x and overflow-y in auto, Grid and Flexbox. 
In the html file you will find some dummy elements that I have put in comment as I assumed that the cards could come from an API call so there could be more of them.
You can uncomment them out to check them.
